# Metal Slader Glory FC: Translation (8x8 Font Edition)

## About
This repository contains source code for patches and tools to compile an English translation of Metal Slader for the Famicom.

This is a fork of the original [metal-slader-glory-fc-en](https://github.com/romh-acking/metal-slader-glory-fc-en) repository. This repo downgrades from an 8x16 font to an 8x8 font to allow for more foreign characters. This makes it easier to translate to other languages.

Spanish characters are supported. For the "robotic" text, there aren't specific characters with accents, so if you want an á, wite out "`ａ" instead. However, only two accent marks characters are supported, due to limitations in the game's engine and RAM.
